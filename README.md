# Py2c_Transpiler

Note: The project code is currently not available. Publication is pending advisor approval.


# Overview
Py2C_Transpiler is a custom tool designed to convert a subset of Python code into optimized C code for resource-constrained embedded systems, such as the PIC18 microcontroller. It aims to combine Pythonâ€™s readability with the performance and low memory usage of C.

# Key Features
-Python-to-C Code Conversion: Converts a subset of Python code into efficient C code suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems.

-Support for Control Structures: Handles essential Python control statements, including if, while, and for loops.

-Data Structure Handling: Transforms Python lists (single and multi-type) and tuples into appropriate C arrays and structs.

-PIC18 Hardware Integration: Supports key PIC18 hardware modules such as UART, ADC, Digital I/O, LCD, and Interrupts.

-Memory-Efficient Design: Eliminates interpreter overhead by generating direct C code, reducing memory consumption and improving execution speed.

-Simplified Embedded Development: Allows developers to write in Python while producing low-level C code optimized for embedded environments.
